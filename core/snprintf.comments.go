/* The maximum precision that's allowed for float conversion. Does not include
 * decimal separator, exponent, sign, terminator. Currently does not affect
 * the modes e/f, only g/k/H, as those have a different limit enforced at
 * another level (see NDIG in php_conv_fp()).
 * Applies to the formatting functions of both spprintf.c and snprintf.c, which
 * use equally sized buffers of MAX_BUF_SIZE = 512 to hold the result of the
 * call to php_gcvt().
 * This should be reasonably smaller than MAX_BUF_SIZE (I think MAX_BUF_SIZE - 9
 * should be enough, but let's give some more space) */
