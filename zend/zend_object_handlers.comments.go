/* The following rule applies to write_property() and write_dimension() implementations:
   If you receive a value zval in write_property/write_dimension, you may only modify it if
   its reference count is 1.  Otherwise, you must create a copy of that zval before making
   any changes.  You should NOT modify the reference count of the value passed to you.
   You must return the final value of the assigned property.

  __X accessors explanation:

  if we have __get and property that is not part of the properties array is
  requested, we call __get handler. If it fails, we return uninitialized.

  if we have __set and property that is not part of the properties array is
  set, we call __set handler. If it fails, we do not change the array.

  for both handlers above, when we are inside __get/__set, no further calls for
  __get/__set for this property of this object will be made, to prevent endless
  recursion and enable accessors to change properties array.

  if we have __call and method which is not part of the class function table is
  called, we cal __call handler.
