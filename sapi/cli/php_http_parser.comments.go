/* Callbacks should return non-zero to indicate an error. The parser will
 * then halt execution.
 *
 * The one exception is on_headers_complete. In a PHP_HTTP_RESPONSE parser
 * returning '1' from on_headers_complete will tell the parser that it
 * should not expect a body. This is used when receiving a response to a
 * HEAD request which may contain 'Content-Length' or 'Transfer-Encoding:
 * chunked' headers that indicate the presence of a body.
 *
 * http_data_cb does not return data chunks. It will be call arbitrarally
 * many times for each string. E.G. you might get 10 callbacks for "on_path"
 * each providing just a few characters more data.

/* Request Methods */

/* If php_http_should_keep_alive() in the on_headers_complete or
 * on_message_complete callback returns true, then this will be should be
 * the last message on the connection.
 * If you are the server, respond with the "Connection: close" header.
 * If you are the client, close the connection.

/* Returns a string version of the HTTP method. */
